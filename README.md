## 1. Linux uppsetning
----------------------

I booted the Ubunut off the USB key. First, i downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 from the official Ubuntu webiste. Then, i made the USB key bootable using the software called Unetbootin. After the software configured the USB key and made it bootable, i plugged in the USB key, changed the boot sequance in BIOS and as result, Ubuntu was up an running. I did however, faced some difficulties in accessing the BIOS, because i own an SSD hard drive and as result, the bootup time of my computer is very fast. Therefore, i had very little time in pressing the F2 key - hence, i had to restart the computer several times in order to succesfully access bios. However, once i started up Ubuntu on my PC, everything was functioning very well - except one major issue -  i could not establish the internet connection, perhaps some network drivers were missing... So, i repeated the same process using my laptop, which is running windows 7. After, booting off the USB key, Ubuntu functioned perfectly in my laptop!     

Here is a screenshot of my machine running linux. I did not have a chance to take a picture while the system was booting up (i simply forgot to take a picture, and since i have booted off the USB, all of my progress would be lost after rebooting. So this is a reason why i could not include the boot up image), however this is a screen shot of the system after the boot up.

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git
-----------------------------

In this part i did not face any difficulties at all. I just typed in the commands provided and after few seconds evertying was ready.

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)
------------------------------

This part also went pretty well. At the beginning, it was relatively hard to work in the linux enviroment, because im so new to it - im very used to windows. Nonetheless, after some research on the common terminal commands and some GIT commands, i started to feel pretty comfortable. Furthermore, i had some hard time in learnig on how to use vim - im so used to nano. Vim seem so new and not so user friendly. Generaly, i dont find it very comfortable to use vim. Also, i would like to point out that, since i was working alone in the group, i did not have any chance of sharing the code with other people. Here is the link to my forket repository: https://github.com/Dovydas2013/INTOPrufa. As instructed, there i edited a file called NIM.cpp by adding two cout commands, which print out my name and my RU id. 

## 4. Uppsettur hugbúnaður
--------------------------

Vim is a charityware. Its license is GPL-compatible, so it is an open software. Therefore, whenever the code is changed, all changes must be made public. Furthermore, it is possible to donate money and all of the donated money would be send to Uganda to help children there, through ICCF. Link where you can find the vim source code: http://www.vim.org/sources.php. By downloading the source code, you could change it and hence, help in further development of the software. 

Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (hence it is free and open source). The source code of git could be found here: https://github.com/git/git. Since it is an open source, anyone can join in and help impriving it.

Here i should fill in the results from last 4 parts again right? if my icelandic is not letting me down... :)
